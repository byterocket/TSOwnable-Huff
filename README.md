`TSOwnable` is a Two-Step Transfer Ownable contract implemented in [Huff](https://github.com/huff-language),
a low-level EVM programming language.

For more information about how to enter the Huff ecosystem, read our accompanying
[article](https://merkleplant.xyz/posts/entering-the-huff-ecosystem).

## Installation

1. Install Huff's [huff-rs](https://github.com/huff-language/huff-rs) compiler and the [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) toolchain
2. Clone and `cd` into the repository
3. Run `forge install`

## Compilation

This project uses Huff's [HuffDeployer](https://github.com/huff-language/foundry-huff) library to
easily compile and test Huff contracts.

## Tests

Run tests with `forge test --ffi`.

> **Warning**
>
> The `HuffDeployer` library uses Huff's `huff-rs` compiler to compile and deploy Huff contracts.
>
> In order to call the `huff-rs` compiler, foundry's FFI cheatcode needs to be activated.
>
> **ONLY USE THE FFI FLAG IF YOU ARE CERTAIN THAT THE CODE IS NOT MALICIOUS!**
